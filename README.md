# challenge-06

## Description:

A simple weather app to display the weather and five day forecast for an entered city.

## What I learned:

I learned that the OneCall weather API is somehow broken for me.  I'd either get a 401, which seemed to indicate my key wasn't authorized yet, or a 400 which would indicate I had something in the url wrong, which doens't seem likely given that I copied it directly from the Open Weather Map website.  So I'm not sure if it was an issue with the key generation or something else was wrong in the url, but I couldn't get the UV feature and subsequent color changes to the cards that I was planning.
